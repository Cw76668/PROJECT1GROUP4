# Our group is designing a database management platform for record labels to manage their businesses. This business will oversee artists’ albums, concerts, and other various income sources to better manage and quantify an artist’s revenue streams. Below are some critical business functions supported by our platform:
  # Artist and album management – The platform tracked signed and managed artists, tracks their albums, and handles music production.
  
  # Royalties – The business also oversees the income made from share of royalties.
  
  # Live event organization – The platform manages concerts, music festivals, and performances where artists showcase their work.
  
  # Managerial oversight – Managers oversee different aspects of the business, ensuring smooth operations.
  
# These are just a couple scenarios that our platform supports.
